## Executive Summary

The increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats have made cybersecurity risk management a critical concern for modern organizations. Traditional cybersecurity approaches, which rely heavily on manual monitoring and reactive incident response, are no longer sufficient to address the dynamic and complex nature of cyber risks. This project examines the role of business analytics in enhancing cybersecurity risk management and demonstrates how analytics-driven approaches improve risk identification, assessment, and decision-making.

The study begins with a comprehensive review of existing literature on cybersecurity risk management and business analytics, highlighting the limitations of traditional security methods and the growing importance of data-driven strategies. Two contrasting case study approaches were examined—traditional cybersecurity practices and analytics-driven cybersecurity frameworks—to understand differences in effectiveness, responsiveness, and risk mitigation capabilities.

To demonstrate the practical application of business analytics, a simulated cybersecurity dataset was created using MySQL. Descriptive and diagnostic analytics were applied to analyze incident frequency, severity levels, response times, risk scores, and data breach occurrences. Key performance indicators such as Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), high-risk incident identification, and department-wise risk exposure were evaluated to assess cybersecurity performance.

The findings reveal that analytics-driven cybersecurity risk management provides superior visibility into security incidents, enables proactive risk prioritization, and significantly reduces response times compared to traditional approaches. Advanced detection mechanisms such as SIEM, endpoint detection, and behavioral analytics were found to be more effective in identifying complex and high-risk threats.

The project also identifies key success factors for adopting analytics in cybersecurity, including strong leadership support, skilled analytics teams, unified data architectures, and a culture of data-driven decision-making. At the same time, challenges such as skill shortages, data silos, integration complexity, and organizational resistance were highlighted.

Based on the analysis, a best-practice analytics-driven cybersecurity risk management framework was proposed, integrating data collection, analytics, visualization, decision-making, and continuous improvement. Practical recommendations were provided to help organizations strengthen their cybersecurity posture through enhanced use of business analytics.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that business analytics is a powerful enabler of effective cybersecurity risk management. Organizations that adopt analytics-driven approaches are better equipped to anticipate cyber threats, improve decision-making quality, and enhance overall organizational resilience in an increasingly digital environment.
